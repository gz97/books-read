### "Hello World" by Hannah Fry

## Introduction
- Algorythms (or solutions in a wider sense) are not inherently good or bad
- "Bad" algorythms often had ill intentions behind them or incompetence

## Power
- We use AI, ML and data in disciplines like medicine, cars, judicial systems without fully understanding where their decisions come from
- There is some evidence suggesting that humans trust technology, possibly because it's *technology* after all, without engaging critical thinking
  - e.g. when GPS leads us to a lake and we drive into it without question
  - or when our opinions can be shaped depending on which results we get first in the Internet browser - which is **dangerous** and very **powerful**
  - algorithms have a, not always deserved, sense of *authority*

- transparency is key, especially when real lives are at stake
  - How can you be transparent with a ML algorithm or neural network? 
  - When challenging an algorithm you need to be more convincing, sure and courageous in your convictions, as you're fighting against people's trust in the machine, not just the machine
- While we're likely to over-trust an algorithm, when we know that it can be faulty, we react by dismissing the algorithm more than we need to
  - it's called *algorithm aversion* 
- We need to find balance between complete trust and complete aversion to algorithms.

## Data
- using an app or a service creates an exchange, a person gets the service, but gives their data
- We're not always aware of the long-terms implications of such an exchange
  - E.g. Tesco started Clubcard by giving out points in return for purchase info. While uncomplicated and limited at first, it quickly became sopisticated and robust. 
- Plantir - data broker in SV. Sells personal data and resells them with profit.
  - data is anonymised, but the sheer volume makes it possible to infer someone's identity. However, often, someone's name can be in the URL which makes it extremely easy to de-anonymise their whole browsing history
  - 'cookies' - a piece of data generated by a visited website which is placed on a user device and stores information on the user's activity
- Cambridge Analytica
  - asked the users of Facebook to take personality tests, handing both their Like and browsing history with their test results
  - ads were tailored based on the personality, e.g. more actioanble for extrovers and more calm and serene for introverts
  - work for the Trump election campaign - targeted people who seemed 'persuadable' with personalised ads, delivered ads dressed as journalism
  - studies suggests that we're actually pretty good in ignoring false advertisement, however a small change in behaviour may still be powerful enough to influence important events
