## Chapter 1: Bank Business and Capital
- return on capital is the focus of all banking activities
  - coordination of these banking activities is the focus of asset-liability management (ALM)

### Types of income streams and costs
#### Interest income
- AKA net interest income (NII).
- main source of revenue for banks worlwide (% of revenue achieved with this type of income can vary between banks)
- generated from lending activity and interest-bearing assets
  - 'net' income is the return on these interests minus the costs of funding loans 
- funding - a cost to the bank, obtained from different sources
  - deposits (key and cheapest source)
  - senior debt (bonds), securitized bonds
  - money market paper
  - they're short-term or available on demand, so must be supplemented with long-term funding
- sensitive to credit risk () and market risk (interest rate risk of loans and deposits)

#### Fees and commissions
- fees are obtained from providing services to customers
- less volatile and not susceptible to market risk (e.g. trading income or NII) or credit risk (as fees are paid upfront)
- fees provide an opportunity to create a diversified customer base for this additional range of services
- fees are of less concern to ALM
- carries operational risk

#### Trading income
- generated through trading activity in financial products such as equities (shares), bonds and derivative instruments
- most volatile source of income and generates high market risk and credit risk

#### Costs
- staff 
- operations (rent, IT, office equipment)
- provisions for loans losses (charges against the loan revenues of the bank, subjective measurement of how much the borrowing portfolio can be expected to be repaid by the borrower)
  
### Capital Markets
**capital market** - market for raising and investing finance
- in traditional sense, can be where *financial instruments* are bought and sold physically or over the phone/online
- two primary users of capital markets are *lenders* and *borrowers*
  - they have inherently different objectives, which is the source of basic conflict. Lenders want to remain liquid and see high return on their investment. Borrowers on the other hand want to invest their funds long-term to maximise profits. This is reffered to as *constitutional weakness*
- Intermediaries come in-between lenders and borrowers to facilitate the efficient operation of capital markets and bring together their needs.
  - an example of an intermediary is a **bank**
  - a bank will accept deposits from investors (*liabilities*) and lend funds to the borrowers (*assets*). 
  - with a sufficiently large asset and liability base, the bank can meet the needs of both investors and borrowers. It will be able to maintain liquidity to meet investors requirments, and create long-term assets to meet the needs of the borrowers.
  - two risks that arise from these operations: large number of investors decide to withdraw their funds at the same time, or a large number of borrowers go bankrupt and default on their loans.
- corporate borrowers can raise capital in several ways:
  - continued re-investment of the profits generated by the current operations
    - this may not generate sufficient funds considering the operational costs and if the company wants to expland
  - selling shares in the company
    - this dilutes the extend of ownership of the existing shareholders, and they may not be apetite for the shares in the market 
  - borrowing from a bank via loans
    - often inflexible 
    - interest rate may be high, especially for smaller companies
  - borrowing money by issuing debt securities, in the form of bills, commercial paper and bonds 
    - this will fix the rate of interest payable by the company for a long-term period
    - bonds are tradeable, which is appealing to investors
- the most common bond is a loan of funds by the buyer to the issuer of the bond, in return for regular interest payments up to the termination date of the loan
